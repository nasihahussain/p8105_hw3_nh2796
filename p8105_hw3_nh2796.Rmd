##problem 1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ny_noaa_df =
  ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date))
```
Some of the key variables here are the precipitation amount, amount of snowfall, the snow depth, the min and max temperatures. The mean snow depth was 37.31 and the mean snowfall was 4.98mm
```{r}
ny_noaa_summary =
  ny_noaa %>%
  summarise(across(c(prcp, snow, snwd), list(min = min, max = max, mean = mean), na.rm = TRUE))
```

snowfall common value

```{r}
common_snowfall_value = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
the most common snowfall value in this dataset besides the days that saw 0 snowfall and the days that had missing data, was 25mm which was observed 38,1221 times. 

##plots
```{r}
janjul_data = 
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(month == 1 | month == 7)

janjul_data$tmax <- as.numeric(as.character(janjul_data$tmax))

avg_temp_data = 
  janjul_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(tmax)) %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  summarise(avg_max_temp = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

 

ggplot(avg_temp_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_max_temp, color = month)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(title = "average max temperature by year")

```


##problem 2
```{r}
demo_data = read_csv(file = "./nhanes_covar.csv")
accel_data = read_csv(file = "./nhanes_accel.csv")
```
